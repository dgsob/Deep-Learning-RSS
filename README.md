## Repo to keep track of DL progress

### Main resources:
- The MT7042-HT24 course-book: ["Deep Learning" by Goodfellow et al., MIT Press, 2016](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
- [Geometric Deep Learning: Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges](https://geometricdeeplearning.com/), the "proto-book"
- Julia Deep Learning library [Lux.jl](https://lux.csail.mit.edu/stable/)

### Theory Concepts:
1. Mathematical Background ([4.3](https://github.com/dgsob/Deep-Learning-RSS/blob/main/theory/DL-chapter4-annotated.pdf), [5.4, 5.5, 5.9](https://github.com/dgsob/Deep-Learning-RSS/blob/main/theory/DL-chapter5-annotated.pdf))
2. Feedforward Networks ([6.1-4](https://github.com/dgsob/Deep-Learning-RSS/blob/main/theory/DL-chapter6-annotated.pdf))
3. Back-Propagation ([6.5](https://github.com/dgsob/Deep-Learning-RSS/blob/main/theory/DL-chapter6-annotated.pdf))
