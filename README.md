## Repo to keep track of DL progress

### Goal:
To be able to:
* Explain basic & modern concepts
* Select appropiate training & validation methods
* Compare pros & cons of different architectures
* Compare pros & cons of different training, regularization & validation schemes
* Perform problem diagnosis & troubleshooting

### Main resources:
- The MT7042-HT24 course-book: ["Deep Learning" by Goodfellow et al., MIT Press, 2016](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
- [Geometric Deep Learning: Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges](https://geometricdeeplearning.com/), the "proto-book"
- Julia Deep Learning library [Lux.jl](https://lux.csail.mit.edu/stable/)
